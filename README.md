# Data-analysis
Performed predictive analysis and modeling between death rate, infection rate and vaccine rate using linear regression
Collected data of over 60 countries using web crawler based on Scrapy in Python and stored data in Mysql
Calculated the correlation coefficient and visualized the data using Numpy, Pandas and Seaborn
Drew conclusion that vaccine rate is irrelevant to infection rate, while the correlation coefficient between infection rate and death rate reached 0.54 (moderate association)
